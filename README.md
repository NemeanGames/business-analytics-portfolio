This portfolio showcases applied analytics projects across data cleaning, exploratory analysis, forecasting, geospatial mapping, text mining and business storytelling. The current featured case study examines the U.S. express car wash industry.

## Executive Summary

- **Rapid expansion:** Major express chains like Mister Car Wash (over 500 locations) and Quick Quack (over 280 locations) are scaling aggressively via new builds and acquisitions.
- **Newcomer growth:** ModWash launched in 2020 and already operates about 97 sites, highlighting how private-equity–backed entrants can disrupt the landscape quickly.
- **Membership value:** Unlimited wash plans priced around $20–30 per month break even after only 2–3 washes, driving strong customer adoption and recurring revenue.
- **Sentiment drivers:** Speed, value and convenience are praised in customer reviews, while inconsistent quality and billing issues are common complaints.
- **Emerging threats:** Warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam’s Club offer $7–8 exterior washes as an add-on, posing a low-cost competitive threat to standalone chains.

## Skills Demonstrated

## Industry Context

The U.S. express tunnel car wash market has consolidated around a handful of super-chains, yet remains highly fragmented overall. Unlimited wash memberships have become the dominant revenue model, with average prices around $25 per month and adoption rates exceeding 70% at some chains. New entrants backed by private capital are expanding rapidly, while big-box retailers like Costco and Sam’s Club are offering ultra-low-priced washes, signalling potential disruption. Analytics can help operators make data-driven decisions on expansion, pricing and customer experience in this competitive landscape.
