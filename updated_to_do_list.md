# Updated Analyst Toâ€‘Do List â€“ Business Analytics Portfolio

This list reflects the current status of the carâ€‘wash market intelligence project as of **August 29, 2025**. It distinguishes between completed work and remaining tasks so you can prioritise your time ahead of the interview.

## âœ… Completed Analytics & Narrative Work

* **Real competitor dataset and cleaning:** Compiled location counts for major express tunnel chains (Mister Car Wash, QuickÂ Quack, ModÂ Wash, etc.) from public sources and created a clean `competitor_dataset.csv`.
* **Exploratory analysis (EDA):** Generated bar and line charts illustrating competitor store counts and historical growth trends.
* **Geospatial mapping:** Simulated store coordinates to demonstrate how to visualise geographic coverage and identify expansion opportunities.
* **Timeâ€‘series forecasting:** Applied exponential smoothing to project ModÂ Washâ€™s store growth out toÂ 2026â€“2027, saving results in `mod_wash_forecast.csv`.
* **Membership ROI analysis:** Modelled breakâ€‘even points for unlimited wash plans versus payâ€‘perâ€‘wash pricing to quantify customer value.
* **Customer sentiment analysis:** Performed basic text mining on sample reviews to highlight common compliments and complaints and produced a sentiment chart.
* **Integrated analyses into report:** Added sections in `report.Rmd` covering data cleaning, EDA, forecasting, membership ROI, sentiment analysis and geospatial analysis.
* **Added caseâ€‘study narratives:** Wrote four businessâ€‘focused case studies (expansion trends, membership ROI, sentiment insights, and bigâ€‘box competition) to contextualise the analytics for decisionâ€‘makers.

## ðŸš§ Outstanding Analytics Enhancements

* **Interactive dashboard:** Build a Shiny or Plotly dashboard to allow recruiters to explore the dataset and forecasts interactively. This remains a stretch goal and is not required for the upcoming interview.

##* âœ… **Enable GitHub Pages:** Enabled Pages in repository settings (Source = GitHub Actions).
* âœ… **Commit and push updates:** Updated report, README, case-study narratives and dataset sections committed to `main`.
* **Verify the live site:** After deployment, test the site at `https://nemeangames.github.io/business-analytics-portfolio/` to ensure charts render correctly and navigation works.
* âœ… **Project-specific README:** Added a `README.md` under `projects/carwash-market-intelligence/` summarising the case study, datasets and scripts.
* âœ… **Repository hygiene:** Added a `.gitignore`, organised the folder structure, and included an MIT licence.
## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact & Presentation
* **Business implications documented:** The report now ties each analysis to strategic decisions (e.g. expansion planning, pricing strategy, service improvements, competitive positioning).
* **Visual polish and narrative refinement:** Finalise the wording and formatting in the report and README to ensure clarity, professionalism and consistent styling. Consider using a corporate colour palette when customising plots.
* **Executive summary:** Craft a concise summary of top findings and actionable recommendations at the start of the README and the report for busy hiring managers.
* **Seek feedback:** Share the draft portfolio with peers or mentors for feedback and incorporate their suggestions before the final submission.

Once the remaining tasks are completed and pushed, the updated portfolio will autoâ€‘deploy to GitHub Pages and provide a live demonstration of your analytic skills and business acumen for your interview.
